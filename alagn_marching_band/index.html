            <p>Established in 2016, the Eagles Marching Band has grown to be a high energy entertaining band. The Eagles Marching Band program provides an outstanding music education and creates positive learning experiences for our student musicians. The Eagles started their competitive marching career off with a bang and received first place in their first ever marching competition. In the three marching seasons that the Eagles have competed, they have finished 15th in 2019, 10th in 2021, and 10th in 2022. The Eagles Marching Band is also a regular in the local Gilbert Days Parade.</p>

        <section class="What-grid">
            <p>The American Leadership Academy Gilbert North Eagles Marching Band is a band that focuses on entertaining the crowd. We play upbeat music that brings life into the crowd, and pumps up our student atheletes. The Eagles Marching Band program is unique due to the fact that as a charter school that is K-12, our Marching Eagles are able to start to learn as early as fifth grade. Even though to compete, students need to be in seventh grade or higher, the students in fifth and sixth grade have many opportunities to play with the band at sporting events. We have a diverse group of students from all walks of life that bring enthusiasm and a passion for performing music.</p>
