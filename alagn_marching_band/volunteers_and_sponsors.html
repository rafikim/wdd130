            <h1>We Need You!</h1>
            <section class="volunteer_info">
                <p>The Eagles Marching Band can't do anything without the help of our volunteers who are called the Eagles Flight Crew. It take many hours and a lot of hard work to help the Eagles to succeed, and acheive their goals. Preparation for the 2023 marching season started in March. The executive booster board is in place, and there are other volunteers in postions. The Flight Crew is always in need of help. There are positions available for volunteers who have a small amount of time to give to positions that require  a lot more of a commitment. If you are wanting to help in any capacity please email our booster president Kristi Graham at eaglesflightcrew@gmail.com.</p>    
                <p>Executive Booster Board: President Kristi Graham, Vice President Tiffany Polley, Treasurer Matthew Graham and Secretary Corinne Webb.</p>

            <h1>Sponsorship</h1>
            <section class="sponsorship_info">
                <p>We love our sponsors! Sponsorship is very important to the success of the Eagles Marching Band. It takes a lot of money to keep the band going. Instruments are expensive, and cost a lot to maintain or repair. The kids eat a lot of food, and you can imagine what that takes to keep them fed. Equipment needs to be transported to and from places where the band performs. Sponsorship is a very helpful way for the band to secure funding that is desperately needed to have a successful season. Sponsorship is a great way to help the Eagles Marching Band, and be able to have your business or message visible to crowds of potential customers.</p>
                <h2>Included With Sponsorship:</h2>
                <p>$250 includes a small logo on the equipment trailer, one marching band sticker and one 2023 marching band t-shirt.</p>
                <p>$500 includes a small logo on the equipment trailer, two marching band stickers, two marching band t-shirts, and two tickets to each home football game.</p>
                <p>$1000 includes a medium logo on the equipment trailer, four marching band stickers, four marching band t-shirts, four tickets to each home football game, and four seats to all band concerts.</p>
                <p>$2500 includes a large logo on the equipment trailer, four marching band stickers, four marching band t-shirts, four tickets to each home football game, and four seats to all band concerts.</p>
                <p>$5000 includes a large logo on the equipment trailer, a 2' x 4' banner that hangs on the stands where the band sits, four marching band stickers, four marching band t-shirts, four tickets to each home football game, and four front row seats to all band concerts.</p>    
                <h2>What Your Sponsorship Will Help With:</h2>
                <p>The band is still a young band that is in need of many instruments and equipment. We are in need of marching tubas, baritone saxophones, drum stands, drum travel cases, a new trailer to carry equipement, and storage equipment to build the inside of the trailer to carry equipment properly. We are also in need of major funding to build a fine arts building where the kids will have all the necessary rooms and storage for all the equipment.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in sponsoring the Eagles marching band at any level, please contact our booster president Kristi Graham at eaglesflightcrew@gmail.com.</p>
                <p>We thank you for your interest in sponsorship in the Eagles Marching Band.</p>
